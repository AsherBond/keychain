keychain is a very simple command line tool for managing passwords

Features include:

- passwords are stored in the blowfish encrypted file $HOME/.keychain
- search for entries using regular expressions
- automatically generates more or less pronouncable random passwords

Usage is very simple, you either start keychain without any arguments
to enter an interactive mode or directly supply the command on the
command line. Commands are:

help                 - print this help
print [pattern]      - print entries matching pattern (patterin is full
                       regular expression. In particular '.*' matches
                       everything, not '*'
store id user key    - add an entry. If key == ?, generates random password
delete id            - delete entry
rename id_new id_old - rename an entry
password             - change master password

Now, although I'm using this script for managing my own passwords you
should carefully read the following disclaimer:

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEES TO ITS
SUITEDNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR USE. IN PARTICULAR, I CANNOT GUARANTEE
THAT THIS SCRIPT WILL NOT ACCIDENTALLY FORGETS YOUR PASSWORDS, OR THAT
THE DATA IS ENCRYPTED IN A FASHION WHICH CANNOT BE CRACKED. THEREFORE,
KEEP YOUR $HOME/.keychain PRIVATE, AND REGULARY MAKE SURE TO STORE
YOUR PASSWORDS SOMEWHERE ELSE. ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO NOT FORGET
YOUR MASTER PASSWORD!

On the other hand, if you have ideas how to improve the security and
the cryptologic strength of the encoding, I'd be happy to know!
